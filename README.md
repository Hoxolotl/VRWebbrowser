# VRWebbrowser
a web browser that loads webpages to populate a 3D VR environment

Built in Godot

Working on the following principles:

Download an HTML page

HTML Elements:
Size of HTML page-> yields size of room
Links -> doors
Images -> canvasses with pictures on the wall


Still need to think:
Javascript, how to implement, what will it do?
